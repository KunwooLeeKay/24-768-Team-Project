**PocketPlay: Real Time Soccer Analytics from A Single Camera**

We present a lightweight real-time computer vision pipeline that extracts ball and player trajectories from a single sideline RGB camera. Using efficient classical vision and geometric methods, the system performs ball detection, player segmentation, field calibration, and tactical metric computation on everyday consumer hardware, without requiring multi-camera setups or wearable sensors. Our approach enables accessible soccer analytics for youth teams, amateur clubs, and community programs, turning ordinary match footage into actionable insights about team shape, ball movement, and tactical flow.
